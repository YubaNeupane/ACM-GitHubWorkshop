    <p>
        Once upon a time, I was born. A while later, I decided that it'd be a good idea to major in Computer Science because technology go blip bloop.
        I've learned a lot of interesting stuff, and it's crazy how it's been 3 years already. Oh yeah I should put other stuff in this too. Uh...
        So I like video games, and that's pretty cool I guess. I'm also into stuff like VFX and animation, so I like to fool around with things like Blender and Unity sometimes. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
